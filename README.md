# addon-ha-hearth

Home Assistant add-on for the [Will Adams-Keane Hearth fork](https://github.com/willadamskeane/ha-hearth), a dashboard for wall tablets, phones and desktops.

## Install

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add add-on repository dialog with a specific repository URL pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwilladamskeane%2Faddon-ha-hearth)

To add the repository by hand, open Settings, Apps, App Store, then Repositories from the overflow menu, and paste `https://github.com/willadamskeane/addon-ha-hearth`. Install Hearth (Will's fork) from the store once the repository is listed, then start it.

Hearth appears in the sidebar and is served over Ingress. Setting a port in the add-on configuration exposes it directly as well, which is what wall tablets should use. Dashboard configuration is stored on the add-on's own volume and survives updates.

## How it builds

`version` in `config.yaml` names the `ha-hearth` tag the image is built from, so the add-on and the application move together. Pushing to `main` builds `ghcr.io/willadamskeane/addon-ha-hearth-{arch}` for `aarch64` and `amd64` against pinned Home Assistant base images.

The published container packages must be public for the Supervisor to pull them. GitHub creates them private on the first push; change that once per package under Packages, Package settings, Change visibility. Later pushes keep the setting.
